This is an experiment on AI learning to drive using the Unity ML-Agents. 

Without giving any instructions, could the AI learn to complete a full lap in 30 seconds while managing a drift handling car?

Rules:
 
- A series of checkpoints (blue) were placed on the track and the agent gets rewarded everytime that goes through the correct checkpoint. 
- If the agent goes through the incorrect checkpoint or hit the walls or barriers, it gets punished.
- Each episode lasts 30 seconds.

The difficulty is avoiding the walls while not losing control of the car.
